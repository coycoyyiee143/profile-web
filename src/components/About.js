        <p>
          I am a web development student with a strong interest in both front-end
          and back-end technologies. I enjoy learning new frameworks and
          constantly improving my coding skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          My hobbies include coding, reading tech blogs, and exploring modern
          JavaScript frameworks. I love building projects that are both
          functional and visually appealing.
